<h1>Keegan's Stuff/Res Patriciae</h1>
<h2>Lingua Latina-style version of Gesta Romanorum</h2>
<p>
    I don't exactly have a system for which things I choose to add marginal notes for; I definitely add one if I personally don't know
    a word. But sometimes I'm feeling generous and add definitions for words that I don't think are in <i>Familia Romana</i>, or whose
    definitions have changed or become less literal.
