**Begin with 1 Thessalonians: imagine that this was the only letter from Paul you had; what would a community of Christians look like?**

1: 
* "Imitators of us and of the Lord....in spite of persecution"
* "Turned to god from idols"
* "to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead"
* "Jesus, who rescues us from the wrath that is coming."

2:
* Why does Paul feel the need to defend his character? In what way could he be "greedy"?  By seeking funds for churches?
* "you...became imitators of the churches...that are in Judea." How did these churches operate?  
* "I, Paul, wanted to [come to you], but Satan blocked our way"

Important aspects here for a community are:
* The imitation of Christ: imitators help themselves and also provide a model of imitation for others
* Christ's resurrection
* A future wrathful event that Christ saves us from.
* Satan as active force impeding Christians.

Then read 2 Thessalonians, which was written shortly afterwards. The events this letter alludes to took place through 40 AD. It’s impressive to have a missionary writing to his congregations in Greece about a new religion just 10 years after a poor Galilean has been crucified in Jerusalem.

2. Continue with Philemon: what does Paul’s conversion of a low status, thieving, lazy, slave tell us about him?

3. Ponder Ephesians: Paul’s manifesto. He is in prison, and maybe only has one opportunity to set out what his gospel is all about. This is it. How does his story of God start?; what happens to Israel?; how should we think about the community?; how should we behave? Then quickly read Colossians. Someone has arrived who is teaching the wrong things—a frequent problem for Paul from here on in. Figure out what the problem was. What does Paul say is being missed out?

4. Read 1 Corinthians, especially chapters 1–2, 12–13, and 15: The theological bases for Paul’s many appeals to a brilliant but divided church can be found in these sections on, respectively, the cross, the body and love, and the resurrection.

5. Read 2 Corinthians, especially chapters 5, 6, and 8: Paul has had his leadership challenged, and responds with deep insights into his life and his calling, and then issues some key challenges to us—about sex and money!

6. Read Philippians: Paul is in jail—again. But note who he is now having to deal with and how he feels about them in ch. 3! Also note carefully how he says that he behaves, as do his special disciples, and how this echoes how Jesus behaved (2:5-11). Then read Galatians, which was probably written just before Philippians to address the same basic problem. Galatians is highly abbreviated so don’t lean on it too hard. (Paul is not always this confrontational.) Go on to the next and final letter for clarifications.

7. Reading Romans in the right, i.e., its theological, order:

Stage 1. Begin in 5–8—the revelation of God’s love: 5:1-11; 8:14-39
Stage 2. Continue in 5–8—Christian life in Christ: 5:12–8:14
Stage 3. Read in 12–15 about the diverse church: 12:1-15:13 (postpone 13:1-7)
Stage 4. Read about God’s people, the Jews: 4:1-25; 9:1-29
Stage 5. Read about how people reject God and what God does about it: 9:30–11:36
Stage 6. Read about why Paul wrote Romans: 1:1-15, esp. v. 15; 15:14-16:27 esp. 16:17-20 (Gal. 1:1-12/24; Phil. 3:2-11/4:1). We learn now that Paul is in Corinth and worried that the false teachers opposed in Philippians and Galatians will reach Rome before him, poisoning that mission field against him. So he writes a long letter pre-empting them. It lays out his gospel (chs. 5–8, 12–15) but it also responds to their criticisms of his gospel (4; 9–11), and it hits their “gospel” as hard as it can. And it does this up front.
Stage 7. Read Romans 1–3 aware that Paul is attacking false teachers and their false gospel using Socratic arguments: 1:18-3:20 (13:1-7). Paul reproduces his enemies’ fiery—and rather nasty—preaching in 1:18-32 against them, and then turns it brilliantly on their own heads. It saves no one—not even those who preach it! (Duh!)

8. I would be tempted now to circle back and read Ephesians again, along with the key passages from 1 Corinthians, and compare those to Romans 5–8 and 12–15:13. This will bed Paul’s key positions down. And then I would read the book of Acts!
