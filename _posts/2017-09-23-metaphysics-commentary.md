# Confusing things:

* The idea of the intellect as separate from matter.
* The distinction between "signate matter" and "sensible matter"

# Intro

## "Most intelligible objects"

**Now the phrase “most intelligible objects” can be understood in three ways. First, from the viewpoint of the order of knowing; for those things from which the intellect derives certitude seem to be more intelligible. Therefore, since the certitude of science is acquired by the intellect knowing causes, a knowledge of causes seems to be intellectual in the highest degree. Hence that science which considers first causes also seems to be the ruler of the others in the highest degree. **

Explanation 1: "Most intelligible" are those objects from which we derive certainty. That is, greater certainty is greater intelligibility.  From which objects do we derive most certainty?  Causes. For understanding causes is the means by which we answer "why" questions.  This brings us to causes as the most intelligible class of object. Among causes, the most intelligible seem to be "first causes".  What these are is unspecified at this point. Contenders in my mind are: God and first principles, like noncontradiction and the PSR.

**Second, this phrase can be understood by comparing the intellect with the senses; for while sensory perception is a knowledge of particulars, the intellect seems to differ from sense by reason of the fact that it comprehends universals. Hence that science is pre-eminently intellectual which deals with the most universal principles. These principles are being and those things which naturally accompany being, such as unity and plurality, potency and act. Now such principles should not remain entirely undetermined, since without them complete knowledge of the principles which are proper to any genus or species cannot be had. Nor again should they be dealt with in any one particular science, for, since a knowledge of each class of beings stands in need if such principles, they would with equal reason be investigated in every particular science. It follows, then, that such principles should be treated by one common science, which, since it is intellectual in the highest degree, is the mistress of the others. **

Explanation 2: What distinguishes the intellect from the senses? Sensation is a cognition of particulars [sensus sit cognitio particularum] : e.g, we see the shape and color of this particular chair.  The intellect, on the other hand, grasps universals [intellectus...universalia comprehendit].  Therefore knowledge is intellectual which deals most with "the most universal principles": being, one/many, potency, act.

It seems natural to address these principles with a "common science", since all the particular sciences make use of these principles.

**Third, this phrase can be understood from the viewpoint of the intellect’s own knowledge. For since each thing has intellective power by virtue of being free from matter, those things must be intelligible in the highest degree which are altogether separate, from matter. For the intellect and the intelligible object must be proportionate to each other and must belong to the same genus, since the intellect and the intelligible object are one in act. Now those things are separate from matter in the highest degree which abstract not only from signate matter (as the natural forms taken universally of which the philosophy of nature treats) but from sensible matter altogether; and these are separate from matter not only in their intelligible constitution (ratio), as the objects of mathematics, but also in being (esse), as God and the intelligences. Therefore the science which considers such things seems to be the most intellectual and the ruler or mistress of the others. **

Explanation 3: Presumably this idea of intellective power as separate from matter is treated elsewhere.  Same with the idea of the intellect and intelligible object as "one in act".  Other confusing terms include "signate matter". I'll leave this aside for now.

...

He goes on to say that these three things (God/being & associated attributes/first causes) are not the subject matter of metaphysics, but only being itself. But insofar as it considers these things separately, metaphysics is called either theology, metaphysics, or first philosophy.

# Lesson 1: "The Dignity and Object of this Science"

## Aristotle

*1. All men naturally desire to know. A sign of this is the delight we take in the senses; for apart from their usefulness they are loved for themselves, and most of all the sense which operates through the eyes. For not only that we may act, but even when we intend to do nothing, we prefer sight, as we may say, to all the other senses. The reason is that of all the senses this most enables us to know and reveals many differences between things. *

Word.

* 2. Animals by nature, then, are born with sensory power. *

Very true.

*3. Now in some animals memory arises from the senses, but in others it does not; and for this reason the former are prudent and more capable of being taught than those which are unable to remember. Those which cannot hear sounds are prudent but unable to learn, as the bee and any other similar type of animal there may be. But any which have this sense together with memory are able to learn.*

Either this is saying something mundane, like: memory of some kind is necessary for learning, and some animals do not have memory.  I think bees do, actually.  But maybe, like, amoebas don't.

But it seems to also be implying that memory arises from hearing, which seems unwarranted.

*4. Thus other animals live by imagination and memory and share little in experience, whereas the human race lives by art and reasoning.*

Unclear what he means by experience.  I remember this being a thing in earlier readings. 

*5. Now in men experience comes from memory, for many memories of the same thing produce the capacity of a single experience. And experience seems to be somewhat like science and art.*

Oh, there we go. Experience is that which is constituted by many memory of the same thing.  Experience is like science and art? Maybe: Art is the ability to create something. And art is "constituted" by the repeated creation of the same thing.  Likewise, sort of, with science and repeatedly learning things about that science's object.

*6. But in men science and art come from experience; for “Experience causes art, and inexperience, luck,” as Polus rightly states. Art comes into being when from many conceptions acquired by experience a Single universal judgment is formed about similar things. For to judge that this [medicine] has been beneficial to Callias and Socrates and many other individuals who suffer from this disease, is a matter of experience; but to judge that it has been beneficial to all individuals f a particular kind, as the phlegmatic, the bilious, or the feverish, taken as a lass, who suffer from this disease, is a matter of art.*

This is sort of what I was saying. I took art to be what he discussed in N.E VI, which is the intellectual virtue concerned with making things.  But here it sounds like any ordered body of knowledge.

*7. In practical matters, then, experience seems to differ in no way from art. But we see that men of experience are more proficient than those who have theory without experience. The reason is that experience is a knowledge of in singulars, whereas art is a knowledge of universals. But all actions and processes of generation are concerned with singulars. For the physician heals man only incidentally, but he heals Socrates or Callias, or some individual that can be named, to whom the nature man happens to belong. Therefore, if anyone has the theory without experience, and knows the universal but not the singulars contained in this, he will very often make mistakes; for it is rather the individual man who is able to be cured.)*

So, experience is a way of connecting particulars and universals: Such-and-such a disease in such-and-such a person leads one to an understanding of both man and disease as universals.  One could of course just learn about man and disease, perhaps from a book, but then one would lack these connections between the particular and the universal, and would more likely act incorrectly.

*8. Yet we think that scientific knowledge and the ability to refute objections belong to art rather than to experience, and we are of the opinion that those who are proficient in art are wiser than men of experience, implying that it is more according to wisdom to know as one pursuing all things.*

Reading this as pejorative, it contradicts the previous account of the importance of experience and the ineptness of art without it.  But if it just is definitionally the case that wisdom has to do with art and not with experience (and NE VI indicates this), then this makes more sense.

*9. Now this is because the former know the cause whereas the latter do not. For those who have experience know that something is so but do not know why, whereas the others know the why and the cause. For this reason, too, we think that the master planners in each art are to be held in greater esteem, and that they know more and are wiser than the manual laborers, because they understand the reasons for the things which are done. Indeed, we think that the latter resemble certain inanimate things, which act but do not know what they do, as fire burns. Therefore inanimate things perform each of their actions as a result of a certain natural disposition, whereas manual laborers perform theirs through habit, implying that some men are wiser not insofar as they are practical but insofar as they themselves have the theories and know the causes.*

Does this account jive with the praiseworthiness of the virtuous person? A virtuous person may merely possess the virtues but not be able to give a rational account of them. Perhaps that person is good but not wise, just like the manual laborer can be skilled but not wise.  The manual laborer may in fact be able to build things that the master planner cannot, and the merely good person may in fact be better than the virtuous virtue theorist. 

*10. In general a sign, of scientific knowledge is the ability to teach, and for this reason we think that art rather than experience is science. For those who have an art are able to teach, whereas the others are not.* 

Right. And the laborer-as-inanimate analogy isn't quite perfect, because a manual laborer can certainly teach. Experience can bring scientific knowledge in some form.

*11. Furthermore, we do not hold that any one of the senses is wisdom, since the cognition of singular things belongs especially to the senses. However, these do not tell us why a thing is so; for example, they do not tell us why fire is hot but only that it is so.* 

Sure.

*12 It is only fitting, then, that the one who discovered any art whatsoever that went beyond the common perceptions of men should be admired by men, not only because of some usefulness of his discoveries, but as one who is wise and as distinguishing [a thing] from others. And as more of the arts were discovered, some to supply the necessities of life, and others to introduce us [to the sciences], those who discovered the former were always considered to be wiser than those who discovered the former, because their sciences were not for the sake of utility. Hence, after all such arts had already been developed, those sciences were discovered which are pursued neither for the sake of pleasure nor necessity. This happened first in those places where men had leisure. Hence the mathematical arts originated in Egypt, for there the priestly class was permitted leisure. The difference between art and science and similar mental states has been stated in our work on morals.* 

Yeah, here again, wisdom is praiseworthy precisely because it lacks utility. Very against our instincts as 21st century western capitalists.

*13. Now the reason for undertaking this investigation is that all men think that the science which is called wisdom deals with the primary causes and principles of things. Hence, as we have said before (8, 9), the man of experience is considered to be wiser than one who has any of the senses; the artist wiser than the man of experience; the master planner wiser than the manual laborer and speculative knowledge wiser than practical knowledge. It is quite evident then, that wisdom is a science of certain causes and principles.*

Is that a reason? Maybe: It's good to be wise, and the highest wisdom comes from this science, therefore it is good to study this science of primary causes and principles.

## Aquinas

**1. Aristotle first sets down an introduction to this science, in which he treats of two things. First (2), he points out with what this science is concerned. Second (53), he explains what kind of science it is (“That this is not a practical science”).**

**In regard to the first he does two things. First, he shows that the office of this science, which is called wisdom, is to consider the causes of things. Second (36), he explains with what causes or kinds of causes it is concerned (“But since we are in search”).**

**In regard to the first he prefaces certain preliminary considerations form which he argues in support of his thesis. Second (35), he draws a conclusion from these considerations (“Now the reason for undertaking”).**

**In regard to the first he does two things. First, he makes clear the dignity of scientific knowledge in general. Second (9), he explains the hierarchy in knowing (“Animals by nature”).** 

**Now he establishes the dignity of scientific knowledge from the fact that it is naturally desired as an end by all men. Hence, in regard to this he does two things. First, he states what he intends [to prove]. Second (1), he proves it (“A sign of this”).**

**Accordingly, he says, first, that the desire to know belongs by nature to all men.** 

Okay, first we're going to talk about the dignity of scientific knowledge and the hierarchy of knowing. We're going to see that science is dignified because all men by nature desire to know it.

**2. Three reasons can be given for this:**

**The first is that each thing naturally desires its own perfection. Hence matter is also said to desire form as any imperfect thing desires its perfection. Therefore, since the intellect, by which man is what he is, considered in itself is all things potentially, and becomes them actually only through knowledge, because the intellect is none of the things that exist before it understands them, as is stated in Book III of The Soul, so each man naturally desires knowledge just as matter desires form.**

The perfection of the intellect is a matter of knowledge only? Are the intellectual virtues a matter of knowledge?
