I am confused about the post-truth era. Both my allies and my adversaries seem to have a deep cynicism about facts, and I don't know why.  I agree that facts are slippery and that the media is not a wholly reliable source.  But why is this surprising? No source has ever been wholly reliable. It has always been incumbent on us to weigh the information we receive.

I offer some suggestions that have always proven useful to me:

1. Read books first: Notably, read books that academics recommend. You could try the various "ask" communities on Reddit (e.g, [askhistory](http://www.reddit.com/r/askhistory)).  Also, don't forget about textbooks. Used textbooks are cheap, efficient ways to absorb the current consensus of a field. Even if you just skim textbooks and academic texts, you'll be miles ahead.
2. Stop reading facebook articles.  Your friends are lovely, but none of them have done their research. 
3. Stop losing your shit about sources: Breitbart is capable of correctly claiming the sun will rise tomorrow. Same with the New York Times. Truth is not partisan. You should be asking the same ququestions about every claim you encounter.
